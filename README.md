Dual Buttons Joy Switch for Commodore 64

C64 JOY SWITCH redirects some PINS from PORT1 to PORT 2 of
your Commodore 64. 

Some games uses SPACE BAR for lancing BOMBS and more, 
this circuit redirect FIRE from port 1 to second button on port 2.
You can also set your second button as UP on games who needs
fast UP, like WONDERBOY or GHOST'N & GHOST


You need a compatible C64 JOY with TWO separated buttons
